The traditional route covers 38km with 1,585m of elevation. Doing it twice shows this wasn't a one-off \u2014 it's a challenge you respect enough to revisit.",
    lessons: "Pacing on the descents matters as much as the climbs. The second attempt was smoother and faster \u2014 proof that experience compounds. Whernside's ridge in wind is no joke. Fuel early and often on multi-peak days.",

Standing on the summit cairn, on the roof of Britain, is a moment that stays with you.",
    lessons: "Altitude weather changes everything. Layers system and wind protection are non-negotiable above 1,000m. The descent is harder on the knees than the ascent \u2014 take it slow. Navigation matters even on the 'tourist route' when cloud rolls in.",

The South Downs Way rolls through some of England's most beautiful chalk downland, but at 50km you stop noticing the scenery around km 35 and start having a very honest conversation with yourself.",
    lessons: "First experience of the 'dark patch' that hits around 35-40km. The mental wall is real \u2014 but it passes if you keep moving. Nutrition strategy needs to start from km 0, not when you're already depleted. Walking poles save energy on the rolling terrain.",

    story: "Walking the entire Northern Line on foot \u2014 hitting all three end stops: Edgware, High Barnet, and Mill Hill East. Urban endurance is its own beast entirely. No trails, no scenery payoff, just grinding through London's sprawl on concrete pavements. Navigating the city on foot gives you a completely different perspective \u2014 you see how neighbourhoods bleed into each other, how the city breathes between the tube stops.",
    lessons: "Urban walking is mentally harder than countryside \u2014 there's no scenery reward to keep you going. Concrete is brutal on joints compared to trails. Navigation through a city is surprisingly challenging when you're tired. Good mental toughness training for ultras.",

This tests both physical endurance and the ability to keep pushing when every peak feels like it should be the last. The cumulative elevation gain is savage, and the mental game of 'only 7 more... only 6 more...' is uniquely challenging.",
    lessons: "Nutrition timing is critical on multi-peak days. Eat before you're hungry, drink before you're thirsty. The middle peaks are the hardest mentally \u2014 you're too far in to quit but too far from the finish to see the end. Break it into blocks of 3.",

After km 70, it stops being a physical event and becomes an entirely mental one. Your body adapts if you let it \u2014 but your mind has to lead.",
    lessons: "After km 70, it's 90% mental. The body will keep going if you let it. Night walking needs specific preparation \u2014 headtorch, layers, navigation confidence.
